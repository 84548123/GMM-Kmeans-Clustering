1) GMM provides better clustering results than KMeans for this dataset. The clusters formed by GMM are well-defined and better represent the underlying structure of the data.

2) This is because GMM can adapt to clusters of different shapes and densities, while KMeans is restricted to spherical clusters.

3) Therefore, for datasets with complex cluster shapes, GMM is a more suitable choice.
